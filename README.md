# Rodent-Rampage
A few sample scripts from a mobile game that I designed and developed using C# and Unity

The following are scripts that I worked heavily on as a part of a team for MassDigi's Summer Innovation Program. 
These scripts are attached to Game Objects in the Unity game engine and are therefore able to control the behavior of that object and any attached components. 
Parallax: is attached to each of the background layers and a depth is set in engine to create the illusion of movement with depth
GameManager: is attached to an empty GameManager object and is carried accross scenes to control the majority of the game's functionality
DTDEvents: holds methods that are called through when relevant to collect analytics information
PowerupFunctions: holds methods that are called depending on which powerups are picked up and active on the player

This game has been released on both the iOS and Android app stores and is available for download.
